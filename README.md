# A dash application with multiple filters in a composite menu

Wilson Chen

This dash application makes a box plot of the Tips dataset from Seaborn package. It allows users to arbitrarily 
choose a grouping factor, a splitting factor and different levels to visualize the data. Its menu also has 
hide/show and select all/none/latest features in composite menu that were coded in object-oriented style.

The goal of this experimental Dash app is to:

1. Explore the coding style of writing dash components in class (Object Oriented).
2. Experiment how to make composite design of menu with sub items

To run the app, users may simply run the python file in Pycharm or type "python dash_test1.py" in terminal.
