A dash application with multiple filters

Wilson Chen

The goal of this experimental Dash app is to:

## Explore the coding style of writing dash components in class (Object Oriented).
## Experiment how to make composite design of menu with sub items

This dash application make a box plot of tips dataset from seaborn package. It allows users to arbitrarily 
choose a grouping factor, a splitting factor and different levels to visualize the data. Its menu also has 
hide/show and select all/none/latest features in composite menu that were coded in object-oriented style.
